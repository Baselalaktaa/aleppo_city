            Aleppo is a city in Syria, which serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Governorate of Syria.
            With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's second-largest city and also one of the largest cities in the Levant region.
            <br />
            Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia.
            <br />
            For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region.
            The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia.
            It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006.

          <p class="text-body1">
            The Citadel of Aleppo is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo, northern Syria.
            It is considered to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world.
            <br />
            Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC.
            Occupied by many civilizations over time – including the Armenians, Greeks, Byzantines, Ayyubids, Mamluks and Ottomans  – the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period.
            <br />
            An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society.
            Dominating the city, the Citadel is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986.
